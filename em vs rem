1 em means same as parent
2 em means double of parent
If you compound elements with font sizes in em, they'll be multiplied to their parents' size and might result in huge unwanted sizes

By default the size is 16 pixels
rem works with relation to html, it's root em.. so it doesn't cause compounding
If you set margins or paddings using ems, then it looks relative to the font size of that element
The trick is to set other units as rems and then whenever you use a media query, just change the font size of the html, so all of it will adjust according to that

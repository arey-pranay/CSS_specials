Tailwind CSS Tutorial #12 - Grids
In this tailwind css tutorial we'll take a look at the css grid classes available to us.

You can create really awesome responsive layouts by using grids and media queries.
Just remember, start mobile-first, and then add an md: or lg: whenever needed

--This is how you create a grid with Tailwind CSS

<div class="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  <div>01</div>
  <!-- ... -->
  <div>09</div>
</div>

!! The interesting complex part !!

If you want to justify the grid cells themselves (they're the contents of the grids), you use:
justify-normal	
justify-start	
justify-end	
justify-center	
justify-between	
justify-around	
justify-evenly	
justify-stretch

But if you want to align the things present inside these invisible cells, then you use:

justify-items-start
justify-items-end	
justify-items-center	
justify-items-stretch

Some more info about these properties

grids are by default
justify-items-stretch for x
items-stretch for y 
Items are stretched in the rows and columns
This applies to Items in each grid cell

To space the cells themselves
justify-start justify-end
For y, it's content-start, content-between

in -start and -end.. the container takes as little space as needed and moves to start or end

and yeah flex justify-end items center is a good class set for a navbar with a logo on left end, a ul on right, and the ul's elements are centred in their resppective cells ig.
